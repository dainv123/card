# My Knowledge Sharing Platform

## Description
My platform for sharing knowledge where I believe everyone can benefit, offering free templates that I've personally developed and refined. Users are welcome to register on my website and freely utilize these resources for their own projects.

## Technical Stack
I'm developing a web application using:
- **React** for the front end
- **Express.js** for the backend
- **MongoDB** for the database
- **GraphQL** for querying data

The application will be deployed on Heroku once it's completed.
